# Streamlit App Deployment
Context: Streamlit application deployment consists of several options: localhost, Streamlit Community Cloud, and cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Official Streamlit documentation provides in-depth guidance on how to deploy a Streamlit application with Streamlit Community Cloud, but lacks in-depth guidance on how to deploy with other cloud providers.
